problems?
  "case ni of Rel -> .. Stmt -> .."
    Functions with that problem
      isTpltOfRel
      graphSupportsRelIdxInNode
      more
    If I tolerate those case statements now will they proliferate or have other negative consequences later?
  "if (Maybe.isJust nMb) ... else error ..."
    function nodeIdxToNode
  too long
    function addRelAtIdxToGraph
to do?
  make graph operations Maybe or Either, and use <|> on them
    I can monkey those words but I don't really know what I'm saying.
  use typeclasses
    So far I only use data statements.
  simplify by hiding graph in State monad
