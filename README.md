The Reflexive Set of Labeled Tuples, or RSLT, is a new data structure, only slightly more complex than the graph. Unlike other data structures, the RSLT is expressivity-maximal: it can represent any kind of information.

The [introduction](/introduction) folder contains three or four great places to start:

* The [paper](/introduction/the_rslt,_why_and_how/it.pdf), which explains what the RSLT is and why it is helpful.

* The [interactive demonstration](/introduction/demo.hs) of how the RSLT represents data. The [howto](/howto) folder shows how to do other things, such as parse a Freeplane .mm file or search along branches.

* If you are interested in the code itself, the [simplified model](/introduction/Minimal_Types.hs) of the type system is a good place to start. A harder but still plausible place to start would be [Graph.hs](/src/Dwt/Graph.hs).
