The folder "introduction" contains three or four great places to start.

You might try the [paper](/introduction/the_rslt,_why_and_how/it.pdf), which explains what the RSLT is and why it is helpful.

There is an [interactive demonstration](/introduction/demo.hs  of how the RSLT represents data. The [howto](/howto) folder shows how to do other things, such as parse a Freeplane .mm file or search along branches.

If you are interested in the code itself, the [simplified model](/introduction/Minimal_Types.hs) of the type system is a good place to start. A harder but still plausible place to start would be [Graph.hs](/src/Dwt/Graph.hs).
