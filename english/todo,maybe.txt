to do?
  make graph operations Maybe or Either, and use <|> on them
    I can monkey those words but I don't really know what I'm saying.
  use typeclasses
    So far I only use data statements.
  simplify by hiding graph in State monad
problems?
  "case ni of Rel -> .. Stmt -> .."
    Functions with that problem
      isTpltOfRel
      graphSupportsRelIdxInNode
      more
    If I tolerate it now will it have worse effects later?
  too long
    function addRelAtIdxToGraph
  "if (Maybe.isJust nMb) ... else error ..."
    function nodeIdxToNode
