In brief: Identity in the semantic sense -- what a recorded idea is -- could be unified with identity in the address sense -- where you can find the idea.

# Goal: Building a graph should feel like writing text.

For instance, write something like "smsn #(is good for) writers" to create an "is good for" link from smsn to writers.

# Goal: Sharing should be easy

I want to be able to connect ideas to (the object in the graph called) smsn, and so does Josh, and we want to be able to share those notes.

# Solution: Text as ID

If the ID where we keep the word "smsn" is some random string of symbols, then we both have to make sure we're keeping "smsn" at the same ID. If its ID is its text content, then we don't have to know ahead of time where the other keeps it.

# Even better: Synonyms

I might add to the graph a long string of text, such as a synopsis of a story I read. If the text content of that is equal to its address, then its address takes a lot of characters to represent. But there are other ways to refer to it.

If it is the only thing connected to "the movie I watched on Jan 1 2014", then it could be referred to that way. If it is not, but it was the first so connected, it could be referred to as "the firs tthing that was connected to [the movie I watched on Jan 1 2014]". If Josh called it an amusing synopsis, we could refer to it as "the (nth) synopsis Jeff wrote that Josh labeled 'amusing' (on [date])", where the parentheticals are optional.
