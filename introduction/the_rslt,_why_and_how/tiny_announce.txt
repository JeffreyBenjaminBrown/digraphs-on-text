Tables can only express certain kinds of data. Trees, only certain kinds of data. Lists, sets, maps, tuples; only certain kinds of data.

The expressivity limits of data structures are a problem, because information that cannot be represented cannot be processed automatically. Medicine provides the most stark example of the problem, but it is ubiquitous.

The Reflective Set of Labeled Tuples (RSLT) is a data structure, only slightly more complex than a graph, that can represent any kind of data.

I wrote a short paper describing the RSLT. It requires no familiarity with computer programming.
