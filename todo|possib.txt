problems?
  "case ni of Rel -> .. Stmt -> .."
    Functions with that problem
      isTpltOfRel
      graphSupportsRelIdxInNode
      more
    If I tolerate it now will it have worse effects later?
  too long
    function addRelAtIdxToGraph
  "if (Maybe.isJust nMb) ... else error ..."
    function nodeIdxToNode
to do?
  graph operations should be Maybe or Either, and use <|> on them
    I can monkey those words but I don't really know what I'm saying.
  could simplify by hiding graph in State monad
