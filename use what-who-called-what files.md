# Name persistence, version control, and the internet

It's a problem that names for files change. Tim Berners Lee wrote about this in [Design Issues with Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html).

A simple* solution would be to keep `what-who-called-what` files. Keeping them for URLs and URIs would solve a lot of "404 errors".

They would also be helpful for ordinary natural language. Someone reading notes on economics, for instance, might be better able to select portions to read if they knew that "econometrics" means "statistics" to economists.

If your data is in VCS software, you're halfway there.

If you keep your text knowledge in [Semantic Synchrony](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki), you can view an expression's Git history as if it was part of the graph of expressions. Soon that kind of view will also encompass whole files.

## * Is it simple?
Keeping the data is simple.

Writing code to use the data seems simple, but I have not.

Getting everyone to adopt the habit seems hard. However, if a publisher can't be bothered, someone else could still rescue their data for them. The rescuer might have to interview the rescuee for a while, or maybe on a continuing basis as new mystery terms are discovered.
